This repository contains a simple COBOL program demonstrating a potential integer overflow bug. The program adds 1 to WS-AREA-1 and then adds the result to WS-AREA-2.  If the value of WS-AREA-1 becomes too large, an integer overflow can occur. The solution demonstrates a method to handle potential integer overflow and prevent it in the program.
